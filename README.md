# BAC-TP-2022

Welcome to the BAC-TP-2022 repository! This repository contains corrected TP exams for the Baccalauréat (BAC) from 2008 to 2021. These corrections are intended to provide helpful guidance and solutions for students studying for their BAC exams.
## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide students, teachers, and anyone interested in the BAC TP exercises with accurate and improved solutions. It serves as a resource to learn and practice Python programming by studying the corrected implementations.


## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

├── 2008
│ ├── TP1

Each year has a directory containing subdirectories for each TP. Within each TP directory, you will find the correction in PDF format and the solution code in Python (`solution.py`).
